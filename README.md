TCP
Experimentation with Linux TCP versions

- transfer bulk data between two hosts

- The behavior of three different TCP congestion control algorithms is studied according to different network
  performance parameters. Specifically, it is tested how different TCP versions react to the traffic congestion
  considering transmission delay of 10 ms, packet loss of 0.1% and packet duplication of 0.5%
